"""Verify every evidence locator in the register still resolves.

This script is DELIBERATELY NOT part of the test suite. The suite is offline by
contract, and a test that needs the network is a test that fails on a plane, in
CI without egress, and on the day someone's blog goes down -- which teaches the
team to ignore red. So link-rot is checked out of band, on purpose.

The VERDICT logic is nonetheless reachable from an offline suite, through `main`'s
`check_fn` seam: exactly one line of this tool touches the network, and injecting
that line makes every summary, refusal and exit code provable with no socket.

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_locators.py [records_dir]

Exit codes: 0 every CHECKED locator resolves, 1 at least one does not, 2 bad usage or nothing was checkable.

    Two things make the report honest rather than merely present.

    The summary publishes the CHECKED count next to the DISTINCT one, because those two
    numbers used to be the same number: a non-http locator was printed as a SKIP and then
    never counted anywhere, so a register in which NOTHING was checkable still printed
    "N distinct locator(s), 0 broken" and exited 0 -- a clean bill of health over zero
    work. `checked + skipped == distinct` holds by construction below, so a reader never
    has to subtract to learn the denominator the other numbers are relative to.

    And a run that checked nothing returns 2 rather than 0. This tool is the only thing
    standing behind the register's locators, so "no breaks found" from a run that looked
    at none of them is the register telling its curator that unverifiable evidence is
    verified evidence -- the same vacuous success `radar validate` was made to refuse over
    a zero-record domain, arriving through a different door.

    `check_fn` is a SEAM resolved at CALL time, never bound as a signature default: a
    default argument is evaluated once at definition, so `check_fn=check` in the signature
    would capture this module's `check` forever and silently ignore any later substitution
    of it. That failure reads as a dead network rather than as an unusable seam.
